# S4-rest-api-practice

Implementation of a Rest API for a simple student registration system. Used Node.js and Express for the core, plus some additional modules like path and body-parser to simplify some stuff.
For data just used hard coded examples.

Used postman + browser to try out the requests.

To run:
node server.js
